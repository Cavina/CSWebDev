I am going to try to finish Colt Steele's Web Dev course.
I completed a fair amount of it awhile back, but didn't finish.

I want to finish it up, so that I can work on my own Web App idea.
Although I could have done this already in Python/Django, I had not yet completely learned JS
well enough to feel competent.  This course should be enough to get me started.
